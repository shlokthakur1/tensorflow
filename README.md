# Tensorflow Projects
This repo contains all the machine learning projects/competitions I've done using tensorflow via Jupyter Notebook and R
The datasets are including in the project folders and so are the training/testing split versions I used for my optimal model. The model is also saved in the project folder. Below are brief summaries of the projects I undertook

### Animal Classification
This was a Kaggle competition in which I came 4th (https://www.kaggle.com/c/fit3181-s2-2021-animal-classification/leaderboard) under the alias 'Probably Overfitting'. The dataset were images on 10 different types on animals the varied from lions to cows to even butterflies, later on this model could be expanded to include more and more animals, and the model should be able to perform well under such complex situations as I used a number of effective techniques such as GAN (Generalized Adversials Network) training alongside image augmentation techniques like data mixup and flipping/resizing of images.

### Fashion MNIST Classification
This was a very simple image classification problem that I undertook to solidify my learnings about Convolutional Neural Networks and Image classification techniques. Still I undertook a lot of pre analysis like image visualisation and train/test split that is essential in Machine Learning practices. This project displays my basic ability to use tensorflow and strong foundation in Machine Learning practices.

### NLP - Question Classification
This project was a self-project where I took text data from a source website (https://cogcomp.seas.upenn.edu/Data/QA/QC/) and built a TextCNNs and RNNs. I experimented on both types of structures and using the hypertuning method Grid Search I chose an optimal model for the experiment. I then expanded this and used the NLP mechanism of attention, I applied this to my RNN model to create a better performing model that can be used for a number of NLP tasks. 

There were a number of pre- context tasks I during the experiment to grasp a better understanding of NLP, such as Word2Vectors and mapping them in a 3-D plot.


### Wikipedia Forecasting Regression
This project was a group project that I undertook with 2 other students with guidance from a experienced researcher, it was a project for high achieving students that provided us research and academic publishing experience, it's not an official research paper but very similar. The data task was also unique and required us to learn a number of new forecasting skills, especially since it was a regression problem and not a classification problem which most machine learning projects I've undertaken on tensorflow are, it provided me a lot of new learnings.
