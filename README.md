# Tensorflow Projects
This repo contains all the machine learning projects/competitions I've done using tensorflow via Jupyter Notebook and R
The datasets are including in the project folders and so are the training/testing split versions I used for my optimal model. The model is also saved in the project folder. Below are brief summaries of the projects I undertook

### Animal Classification
This was a Kaggle competition in which I came 4th (https://www.kaggle.com/c/fit3181-s2-2021-animal-classification/leaderboard) under the alias 'Probably Overfitting'. The dataset were images on 10 different types on animals the varied from lions to cows to even butterflies, later on this model could be expanded to include more and more animals, and the model should be able to perform well under such complex situations as I used a number of effective techniques such as GAN (Generalized Adversials Network) training alongside image augmentation techniques like data mixup and flipping/resizing of images.
